# React + Vite

This React Web App is a role-based dashboard system that provides access to different sections based on user roles.

🔑 User Authentication: The system validates users with a login form and manages sessions using localStorage.

📌 Role-Based Navigation: Users in different departments (e.g., Production, Sales, Admin) see different menu options.

📊 Auto-Generated Tables: Sales orders and production programs are displayed dynamically in structured grids.

🔍 Data Filtering: The sales orders are filtered based on USERID, allowing admins to see all data while normal users see their assigned tasks.

⚛️ React Hooks Used:The app uses useState for managing state, useEffect for loading data, and useCallback for optimizing filters.

This application ensures an efficient and user-friendly experience by dynamically rendering content based on user roles! 🚀
