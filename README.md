ProManage is a powerful React-based Role-Based Dashboard designed to manage production and sales workflows efficiently. With dynamic role-based navigation, seamless authentication, and real-time data visualization, it ensures that each department accesses only the relevant information.

## 🚀 Features

### 🔑 User Authentication & Session Management
- Users log in via a **secure login form**, with session handling via `localStorage`.

### 📌 Role-Based Navigation
- **Dynamic menus** based on user roles:
  - **Production Users**: Manage production processes.
  - **Sales Users**: View sales data filtered by their `USERID`.
  - **Admins**: Access all sections and data.

### 📊 Auto-Generated Data Tables
- **Sales orders and production programs** are dynamically displayed in structured grids.

### 🔍 Data Filtering
- Sales orders are filtered based on `USERID`:
  - **Admins**: View all data.
  - **Sales Users**: Only see their assigned orders.

### ⚙️ Production Management System
- Includes **Start, Pause, Continue, and Stop** controls for production processes.
- Users can navigate to a **Production Details Page** for in-depth tracking.

### ⚛️ Optimized React Hooks Usage
- Utilizes **`useState`** (state management), **`useEffect`** (data loading), and **`useCallback`** (performance optimization).

### 📁 Data Storage & Backend Simulation
- Uses a **local JSON file** to simulate an actual backend API.
